# Port for `spoken`

This is the BSD Ports system configuration project for spoken.

## Procedure

1. Make sure that the ports system is setup. On FreeBSD, this is done with

    `sudo portsnap fetch extract`

   On DragonFly the procedure is:

   ```
   cd /usr
   sudo make dports-create-shallow
   ```

2. Get rid of the old build directory:

   ```
   sudo rm -rf /usr/obj/dports/src/spoken-port
   ```

3. Bump the DISTVERSION in the Makefile to match the Git tag of the new version.

4. Run the following:
    ```
    sudo make makesum
    ```

   This writes the distinfo file, which is in version control. Make
   sure you commit this when done.

   In the uncommon case where you're rebuilding a release, but reusing
   the same version number, remove the distfile tarball before running
   this command. On FreeBSD, it's in `/usr/ports/distfiles`. On
   DragonFlyBSD, it's in `/usr/distfiles`.

   On DragonFly, the base is `/usr/obj/dports`, so, the commands below
   need to be run via `sudo(8)`. Alternatively, I think that the
   WORKDIR environment variable can be set to a different location
   that's writable by a normal user. On FreeBSD, it's done in `work`
   in the current directory, so `sudo(8)` isn't needed.

5. If the Rust crates have never been defined, or have changed, get the
   configuration for them by doing the following:
   ```
   sudo make cargo-crates
   ```

   Paste the result of this into the Makefile.
   
6. Regenerate the `distinfo` file:
   ```
	sudo make makesum`
   ```

7. Go through package building steps (these are taken from the FreeBSD
   Porters Handbook):

   ```
   sudo make clean
   sudo make stage
   sudo make check-orphans
   sudo make package
   sudo make install
   sudo make deinstall
   ```
8. Get the built package, which wil be here (`<version>` is the DISTVERSION from the Makefile):
   ```
   /usr/obj/dports/src/spoken-port/pkg/spoken-<version>.txz
   ```
